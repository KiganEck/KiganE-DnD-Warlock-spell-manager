# KiganE-DnD-Warlock-spell-manager

The purpose of this project is to be able to efficiently manage spells in combat. 
Firstly, I will create an area to enter and call upon spells that I can use. These will include the spell name and description.
Then, I plan to add an area where the player can say whether they are rested, and how powerfully they cast their spell.

If I had enough time, I would also add the subclasses and specializations as well as racial benefits.
