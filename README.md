# KiganE-DnD-Warlock-spell-manager

The purpose of this project is to be able to efficiently manage spells in combat. 
Firstly, I will create an area to enter and call upon spells that I can use. These will include the spell name, description, and magic level. 
(Need to know if spell is a concentration, needs to be prepared, and how many times it can be cast.)


Then, I plan to add an area where the player can say whether they are rested, have certain spells prepared, and/or how powerfully they cast their spell.
(Combine this with spells that can be used a certain amount of times, can be cast at specific levels, or need to be prepared beforehand.


Combining the above two I will make a way where, in combat, the player can see what spells they have available and what the spells do. 


If I had enough time, I would also add the subclasses and specializations as well as racial benefits.
